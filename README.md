# ASCII Rotating Cube in Zig

A 3D rotating ASCII cube rendered in the terminal using Zig.  
The cube is drawn with characters in the terminal and continuously rotated to create a simple wireframe 3D effect.

## Inspiration

This project is a Zig implementation inspired by the original C version:  
[tarantino07/cube.c](https://github.com/tarantino07/cube.c).

## Prerequisites

- Zig compiler (latest stable recommended)
- A terminal that supports ANSI escape codes for smooth rendering

## Build and Run

```bash
zig build run
